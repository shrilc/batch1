# Fundamentals

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is known for its simplicity and ease of use. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and is now one of the most popular programming languages in the world.

Here are some fundamental concepts of Python:

    Variables: 
        Python uses variables to store data. A variable is a name that represents a value, such as a number or a 
        string. You can assign a value to a variable using the = operator.

    Data Types: 
        Python supports several data types, including integers, floats, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
    
    Operators: 
        Python has several operators, including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
    
    Control Structures: 
        Python uses control structures such as if statements, loops, and functions to control the flow of a program.
    
    Modules: 
        Python has a large standard library of modules that can be imported and used to perform various tasks, such
        as working with files, networking, and web development.
    
    Object-Oriented Programming: 
        Python supports object-oriented programming, which allows you to create classes and 
        objects that encapsulate data and behavior.
    
    Exception Handling: 
        Python has built-in support for handling exceptions, which are errors that occur during the execution of a 
        program. You can use try and except statements to catch and handle exceptions.
