# GIT

GitHub is a web-based platform that is primarily used for version control and collaborative software development. 
It provides a way for developers to store and manage their code, as well as collaborate with other developers on projects.

At its core, GitHub is built on top of a version control system called Git, which allows developers to track changes to 
their code over time. Git makes it easy to collaborate with other developers, as it allows multiple people to work on 
the same codebase without overwriting each other's changes.

GitHub provides a number of additional features on top of Git, such as issue tracking, pull requests, and project 
management tools. These features make it easier for teams to work together and coordinate their efforts.

GitHub is used by millions of developers around the world, and is especially popular among open source projects. 
It is also commonly used by businesses and organizations for internal software development projects.
